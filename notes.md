update ideas:
if enough quotes: quote embed with multiple pages
getquote command
 - param: index[int]
 - retunrs: quote[str]
getquoteindex command 
 - param: quote[str]
 - returns: index[int]
filterquotes 
 - param: mutually inclusive (can have one and the other)
  - index range[str] [optional]
  - subquote[str] [a substring to search through quotes] [optional]
 - returns: list of quotes fulfilling requirements


All future quote lists will include index in front of the quote
